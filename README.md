# ENSE 452 Embedded Systems and Real-Time Software Systems

This repository contains the lab and class assignments for ENSE 452 at the University of Regina.

## Project

This project (found in the project folder) is designed to simulate and manage elevator operations using a Cortex-M3 microcontroller.

### Features:
-  Real-time monitoring and control of elevator movement between different floors.
-  Implementation of a Command Line Interface (CLI) for user interaction and elevator management.
- Integration of FreeRTOS for efficient task management and coordination.
-  Emergency stop functionality to ensure user safety and operational integrity.
-  Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) to handle emergency situations and USART communication.

### Instructions for Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Compile and upload the code to your Cortex-M3 microcontroller using the provided instructions.
3. Connect the necessary peripherals and power up the system.
4. Follow the CLI prompts to interact with the elevator and monitor its operation.
